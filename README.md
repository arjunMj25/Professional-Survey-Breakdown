## Problem Statement

This dashboard is designed for the analysis of survey data. The dataset includes responses from 630 participants representing various job roles, countries, and preferences for programming languages. The objective was to extract actionable insights from the data and display them using the visually engaging and interactive dashboard.


### Overview of steps followed:  

1. Data Cleaning:
- Converted figures from text to numerical formats to ensure precise aggregations andunified job titles and programming language information to maintain consistency.

2. Data Transformation: 
- Modified the data types for essential columns, including age, salary, and job title.

3. Created calculated measures for key metrics such as "Average Salary" and "Happiness Score."

4. Visual Design: Chose visualizations to clarify intricate data points and tailored themes and color schemes to improve readability and visual attractiveness.

# Insights

A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

1. Salary Insights by Job Title :
-  Data Engineers earned an average of $90.05, reflecting strong market demand and the importance of engineering roles in the data pipeline.

- Students/Part-time professionals had the lowest average salary at $47, showcasing a starting point or entry-level compensation.

2. Programming Language Trends :
-  Python is the dominant programming language, particularly popular among:
- Data Engineers (76.32%): Python’s versatility and applicability to ETL and data engineering tasks contribute to this trend.

- Data Analysts (43.75%): Likely due to Python’s growing popularity in analytics and reporting tasks.

The preference for Python suggests its role as a fundamental skill for professionals across most roles.

3. Gender Pay Gap Analysis
- Male/Female salary distribution isn’t explicitly detailed, but this is a crucial area for further investigation, especially within regions like the United States and Canada, where survey data appears concentrated.

4. Role Participation and Count of Voters
  - Data Analysts had a higher count of voters (21), indicating a larger representation of analysts in the survey, which might reflect industry trends or respondent demographics.

  - Students had the least representation (4 voters), highlighting a focus on experienced professionals in the dataset.

5. Happiness Index
-  Work-Life Balance Satisfaction: Scored 5.24/10, indicating moderate satisfaction. This could reflect challenges in balancing professional and personal life in high-demand roles like data science or engineering.

- Salary Satisfaction: Scored 3.71/10, suggesting dissatisfaction with compensation across the board. Even higher-paying roles like "Other" or Data Engineering might feel undervalued relative to effort or market expectations.

6. Country-Specific Observations
-  The majority of respondents seem to be concentrated in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and India. Salary trends or programming preferences could vary by region, and it would be beneficial to break this down further for targeted insights.
